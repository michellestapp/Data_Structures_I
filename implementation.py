# Task 1: Dictionary, Set and Tuple
# Given the following three scenarios, choose the best data structure
# (between a dictionary, set, or tuple) to efficiently store the data. 
# Each scenario ties directly to one data structure. Each data structure will be used only once. 
# You will need to determine which data structure is best for which scenario, and then implement the data structure in Python.
#
# 1)   Store the months of the year as strings. Determine the month in the data structure in which 
#      National Pi Day (March 14th ) exists and print that month to the console. 
#       HINT: The number for Pi, when converted to an Integer, is related to the stored location of the correct month.

# 2)  Store five fruits or vegetables.
#       Add two of your favorite fruits and two of your favorite vegetables to the collection.
#       Iterate over the collection and print each one to the console. 

# 3)  Store information about a user profile. Use literal string interpolation to print the userâ€™s profile information to the console. The profile should consist of the following information:
#       First Name
#       Last Name
#       Email Address
#       Phone Number
